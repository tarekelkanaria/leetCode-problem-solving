# Reverse String

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array <font color="rgb(0 122 125)">in-place</font> with O(1) extra memory.

</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(logn)`

- **Space complexity :** `O(1)`
