# Sort Array By Parity

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Given an integer array `nums`, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return _**any array** that satisfies this condition_.
</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)`

- **Space complexity :** `O(n)`
