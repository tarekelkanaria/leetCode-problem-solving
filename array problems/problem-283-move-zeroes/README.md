# Move Zeroes

---

<font color="#1a237e"> Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)`

- **Space complexity :** `O(1)`
