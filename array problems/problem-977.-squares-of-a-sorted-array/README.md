# Squares of a Sorted Array

---

<font color="#1a237e">

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return _an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order_
</font>

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(nlogn)`

- **Space complexity :** `O(1)`
