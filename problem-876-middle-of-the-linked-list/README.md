# Middle of the Linked List

---

<font color="#1a237e"> Given the </font> `head` <font color="#1a237e">of a singly linked list, return _the middle node of the linked list_</font>.

<font color="#1a237e">If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node</font>.

## Example 1:

![middle of linkedlist example 1](assets/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

```

## Example 2:

![middle of linkedlist example 2](assets/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one
