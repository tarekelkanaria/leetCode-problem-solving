---

<font color="#1a237e"> Given a binary array </font> `nums`, <font color="#1a237e">return _the maximum number of consecutive_</font> `1`<font color="#1a237e">_'s in the array_</font>.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

## About the solution

- **Time complexity :** `O(n)`

- **Space complexity :** `O(1)`
