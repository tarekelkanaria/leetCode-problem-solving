# Fizz Buzz

---

<font color="#1a237e"> Given an integer `n`, return _a string array `answer` (**1-indexed**) where_:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by `3` and `5`.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by `3`.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by `5`.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.</font>.

## Example 1:

```
Input: n = 3
Output: ["1","2","Fizz"]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz"]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: n = 15
Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
```
